# Google-Map-RestfulAPI

This project is a FLASK restful API that uses javascript on the front end. This is a basic bird's eye view of the system:

# The front end
The front consists of a HTML templating engine (Jinja) and Javascript with a bootstrap template.

The javascript is implemented in order to use the google maps API to use route calculations.

# Middleware

The middleware consists of using python-flask and using SQL-Alchemy as a ORM to execute queries, while the backend database is a simple mySQL system.
